# Displaying the parsing results (type classes)

We want to be able to print a textual representation of values
of our `Document` type. There are a few ways to do that:

1. Write our own function of type `Document -> String` which we could then print, or
2. Have Haskell write one for us

Haskell provides us with a mechanism that can automatically generate the implementation of a
*type class* function called `show`, that will convert our type to `String`.

The type of the function `show` looks like this:

```haskell
show :: Show a => a -> String
```

This is something new we haven't seen before. Between `::` and `=>`
you see what is called a __type class constraint__ on the type `a`. What
we say in this signature, is that the function `show` can work on any
type that is a member of the type class `Show`.

Type classes is a feature in Haskell that allows us to declare a common
interface for different types. In our case, Haskell's standard library
defines the type class `Show` in the following way (this is a simplified
version but good enough for our purposes):

```haskell
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String
```

A type class declaration describes a common interface for Haskell types.
`show` is an overloaded function that will work for any type that is an *instance*
of the type class `Show`.
We can define an instance of a type class manually like this:

```haskell
instance Show Bool where
  show x =
    case x of
      True -> "True"
      False -> "False"
```

Defining an instance means providing an implementation for the interface of a specific type.
When we call the function `show` on a data type, the compiler will search the type's `Show` instance,
and use the implementation provided in the instance declaration.

```haskell
ghci> show True
"True"
ghci> show 187
"187"
ghci> show "Hello"
"\"Hello\""
```

As can be seen above, the `show` function converts a value to its textual representation.
That is why `"Hello"` includes the quotes as well. The `Show` type class is usually
used for debugging purposes.

## Deriving instances

It is also possible to automatically generate implementations of a few selected
type classes. Fortunately, `Show` is one of them.

If all the types in the definition of our data type already implement
an instance of `Show`, we can *automatically derive* it by adding `deriving Show` at the
end of the data definition.

```haskell
data Structure
  = Heading Natural String
  | Paragraph String
  | UnorderedList [String]
  | OrderedList [String]
  | CodeBlock [String]
  deriving Show
```

Now we can use the function `show :: Show a => a -> String` for any
type that implements an instance of the `Show` type class. For example, with `print`:

```haskell
print :: Show a => a -> IO ()
print = putStrLn . show
```

We can first convert our type to `String` and then write it to the
standard output.

And because lists also implement `Show` for any element type that has
a `Show` instance, we can now print `Document`s, because they are just
aliases for `[Structure]`. Try it!

There are many type classes Haskellers use everyday. A couple more are
`Eq` for equality and `Ord` for ordering. These are also special type classes
that can be derived automatically.

## Laws

Type classes often come with "rules" or "laws" that instances should satisfy,
the purpose of these laws is to provide *predictable behaviour* across
instances, so that when we run into a new instance we can be confident
that it will behave in an expected way, and we can write code
that works generically for all instances of a type class while expecting
them to adhere to these rules.

As an example, let's look at the `Semigroup` type class:

```haskell
class Semigroup a where
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a
```

This type class provides a common interface for types with an operation `<>`
that can combine two values into one in some way.

This type class also mentions that this `<>` operation should be associative,
meaning that these two sides should evaluate to the same result:

```
x <> (y <> z) = (x <> y) <> z
```

An example of a lawful instance of `Semigroup` is lists with the append operation (`++`):

```haskell
instance Semigroup [a] where
  (<>) = (++)
```

Unfortunately the Haskell type system cannot "prove" that instances
satisfy these laws, but as a community we often shun unlawful instances.

Many data types (together with their respective operations) can
form a `Semigroup`, and instances
don't even have to look similar or have a common analogy/metaphor
(and this is true for many other type classes as well).

**Type classes are often just _interfaces_ with _laws_** (or expected behaviours if you will).
Approaching them with this mindset can be very liberating!

To put it differently, **type classes can be used to create abstractions** -
interfaces with laws/expected behaviours where we don't actually care about the
concrete details of the underlying type, just that it *implements a certain
API and behaves in a certain way*.

Regarding `Semigroup`, we have [previously](../03-html/04-safer_construction.html#appending-htmlstructure)
created a function that looks like `<>` for our `Html` EDSL!
We can add a `Semigroup` instance for our `Structure` data type
and have a nicer API!

Exercise: Please do this and remove the `append_` function from the API.

  <summary>Solution</summary>

Replace this:

```haskell
append_ :: Structure -> Structure -> Structure
append_ c1 c2 =
  Structure (getStructureString c1 <> getStructureString c2)
```

With this:

```haskell
instance Semigroup Structure where
  (<>) c1 c2 =
    Structure (getStructureString c1 <> getStructureString c2)
```

And remove the export of `append_` in `Html.hs`. You won't need to further export anything
as type class instances are exported automatically.

You will also need to replace the usage of `append_` with `<>` in `hello.hs`.
